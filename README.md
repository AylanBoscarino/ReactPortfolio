## My Personal Portfolio 
   My personal page's source code, you can find the page runing [over here](https://aylan-react-portfolio.herokuapp.com/ "my website")

   The page is built in React.js with Redux to manage the state. I'm using 
   [this template](https://dansup.github.io/bulma-templates/templates/personal.html)
   built with Bulma.io, although I did split it into React Components.

   It's not finished yet, I'll be perfecting it wherever I see fit :hammer: :hammer:
